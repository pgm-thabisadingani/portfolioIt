text: "Tomorrowland, a large-scale Belgian outdoor dance event held by WEAREONE in De Schorre in Boom, is the inspiration for Future Island. This project was completed during the first programming term."
tools: "The project mostly focuses on javascript, and we had to work with JSON, arrays of objects, and various data types in js. Of course, CSS and a minimum of HTML were added as a bonus, as the majority of HTML had to be added dynamically using JavaScript."
