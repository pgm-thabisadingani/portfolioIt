text: "Rock Werchter, an annual pop and rock festival held in the small village of Werchter, a suburb of the Flemish-Brabant town of Rotselaar, is the inspiration for Future Island. This project was completed during the first programming term."
tools: "The project mostly focuses on javascript, and we had to work with JSON, arrays of objects, and various data types in js. Of course, CSS and a minimum of HTML were added as a bonus, as the majority of HTML had to be added dynamically using JavaScript."
