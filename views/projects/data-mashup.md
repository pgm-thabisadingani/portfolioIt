text: "The data mash up project was the first in the second term's programming Â module. The goal was to create a clone/replica of Github, an online platform for sharing software, but with a twist. The project centered on retrieving and consuming data from external APIs while also allowing you to create your own internal API using JSON."
tools: " Weather API, Covid cases, Github API, and ReandomUserMe API were among the external APIs. The majority of proposals included dynamically adding data to sites, filtering by ID, and username."
