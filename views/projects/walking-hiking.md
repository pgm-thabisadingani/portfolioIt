text: "The walking/hiking app is a project for the third-term module User Interface Prototyping. This project was a follow-up to the first one we worked on, which was to create a prototype for a mobile app that would be used to locate favorite hiking trails and other attractions. The website for the walking/hiking app had to highlight the app's prototype concept."
tools: " BEM notation, SASS, CSS framework for a grid or responsive styling, Eleventy data, and nunjucks were among the most used during this project."
